Version 0.4, 20-NOV-2017

NOTE: This version is nearly identical with the original one from github.com/ngtk3 but
uses the never oldgtk3 low level GTK 3.22 bindings. The original ngtk3 GTK 3.20 low level bindings
can be regarded as deprecated and will be deleted at some point in the future. Also note that now the
gintro package provides high level GTK3 bindings, so you may not regard this
program as an up to date GTK3 example. 

NEd is a simple GTK3 text editor with special support for the Nim programming
language. It supports syntax highlighting and permanent extended symbol info
displayed on the statusbar at the bottom like symbol origin and procedure
parameters. Checking for errors is very fast, and extended error information is
displayed as tooltips. Plain text search is supported by smart symbol search
with optional replace. For each symbol you can display its definitions with
source code. Splitting the display horizontally or vertically in unlimited
number of views is supported, including multi-view display of a single text
file.

You can optionally hide notebook tabs, scrollbars and line number display.

=== Introduction

This program was started as one more test and example of the
https://github.com/ngtk3[GTK3 bindings] for the http://nim-lang.org[Nim]
programming language, but has evolved fast to a nice and useful tool for Nim
development. Its primary target is GNU/Linux -- it may work also on other
operating systems including Windows or macOSX, but that is untested and will
currently not be active supported by the original author.

If you have no intention coding in Nim language or absolutely do not like the
GTK3 GUI toolkit, then this software is definitely not for you. In the best
case you actually consider doing some GTK3 GUI coding yourself, but that is optional.
And it should be clear that this tool can not really compare with powerful
editors like _Vim_ or _Emacs_ or proprietary editors. Maybe in a later stage
it can become comparable to _GEdit_, the default Gnome/GTK editor. Well not
really, https://www.openhub.net/[OpenHub] reports 100k lines of _C_ code for
GEdit, while this tool has currently less than 2k lines of Nim code, and it
will never have more than a few thousand lines:-)

The largest benefits of this tool is the full nimsuggset integration and easy
customization by hacking the source code.

http://www.gtk.org/[GTK] is not very popular currently -- mailing lists and IRC have very low
activity, which makes it really hard to find community support for coding
problems. Some reasons for this may be that GTK is not really cross platform
with native look and feel, and that it's object oriented design coded in plain
C is a bit strange. But on the other hand its C _API_ makes language bindings
easily available for many programming languages.

The currently used oldgtk3 GTK3 bindings for Nim are not really high level. This means that the
GTK3 widgets can not be extended in the same way as Nim objects, and that it
can be necessary to free objects or memory manually. Both is not really a big
problem, we can use _GObject_ macro system to subclass widgets, we can put
widgets into Nim object or create other references between Nim objects and GTK
widgets, maybe with hash maps. Or we may use
`g_object_set_data()/g_object_get_data()` to extend widgets derived from
GObject base class with custom data. And manual memory deallocation is only
necessary in rare cases, because GTK uses reference counting: Widgets are
generally put into containers like boxes or windows -- when the containers are
destroyed the children are unreferenced and destroyed automatically. This works
not bad in C, and works in Nim also. The low level structure of the oldgtk3
GTK3 bindings has the advantage, that the Nim code has the same basic structure
as C code, so the available C examples can be used as guides. For example this
tool is based on _GTK_Source_View_ C examples and Gnome application
examples.footnote:[https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/ch01s04.html#id-1.2.3.12.5]

Maybe later someone will port NEd to the high level gintro bindings.

The biggest problem is unfortunately that we need some knowledge of GTK3 and
the related libraries when we intent to do serious GUI development. The C API
documentation is really not that bad, but it is large and learning it can take
some time and effort.

=== Install

Currently this editor is only tested on 64 bit _GNU/Linux_ with GTK 3.22 (_Gentoo
AMD64_). You need a working Nim compiler (version 0.17.2 or higher) and a
working installation of Nim's _nimsuggest_ tool. And GTK 3.22 or higher and
related packages, including GtkSourceView and maybe additional the related
developer files.

This repository uses the oldgtk3 nimble package.

Install through Nim's package Manager Nimble is currently not supported due to
name conflicts with old legacy GTK2 packages which are part of Nim's standard
software base.

To install oldgtk3 package and NEd editor open a terminal window and execute
these commands:

----
nimble install oldgtk3
git clone https://github.com/stefansalewski/NEd
cd NEd
bash ./make_it
----

The `make_it` build script is necessary because we have to generate resource
files from the XML source files for the _GUI_. That script calls _gcc_ C compiler,
you may try to modify it for clang. And you may add option `-d:release` to get
a smaler and faster executable without included debugging code.

Note: This tool uses Gnome's gsettings for permanently storing user
preferences. To reset these states this command can be used:

`gsettings --schemadir "." reset-recursively "org.gtk.ned"''

Maybe you want to try the included color scheme and syntax highlight _XML_
file? In that case you may consult the `gedit` instructions. On my Linux box I
put these file where the other GtkSourceView files reside:

----
# as root
cp nimdark1.xml /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles/
cp nim.lang /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/
----

That nim.lang file contains code to generate vertical bars to indicate
indentation, which may look ugly with other color schemes. For that case, just
remove these lines at the bottom of file `nim.lang`:

----
<context ref="indent-pat0"/>
<context ref="indent-pat12"/>
<context ref="indent-pat8"/>
<context ref="indent-pat4"/>
----

Or you may try the syntax-highlighting file from https://github.com/nim-lang/Aporia[Aporia Editor].

=== Launching the Editor

----
./ned file1.nim file2.nim
----

Unfortunately you can launch it for testing only this way, from inside its directory.
When that test is sucessfull, and you intend to really use it, then installing the
gsettings configuration is necessary. One method would be this:

----
# And for making gsettings available system wide one method is, as root
# https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/glib-compile-schemas.html
# echo $XDG_DATA_DIRS
# /usr/share/gnome:/usr/local/share:/usr/share:/usr/share/gdm
# cd /usr/local/share/glib-2.0/schemas
# cp org.gtk.ned.gschema.xml .
# glib-compile-schemas .
#
----

Unfortunately that can be done only with administrator rights, and I don't know
how it could be done on Windows or Mac. 

=== Using the Editor

The title bar of the _Gnome Desktop_ should display a _NEd_ menu with a _Preferences_ item,
which allows
you to select fonts and color schemes, and other configuration options.
Proportional fonts are supported, but some have tiny spaces unfortunately. You
may try the _Input_ font series, which are free of charge for personal use.
For medium size (27") 4k displays the overpass fonts look nice, I am using them for the whole
Gnome desktop currently. The
preferences dialog allows to tune display of line numbers, notebook tabs and
scrollbars. And you can change some search options. The _Gears_ menu on the
top right of the main window has entries for splitting the current view vertically
or horizontally -- you can change the size of the split views with an invisible
slider. And you can reposition notebook tabs by grabbing the tab with the
textual label and moving it onto other tabs (drag and drop). (That does not
work when tabs are hidden, and needs some skills: Mouse pointer changes shape
when drop position is reached.) Generally new views are opened in the
notebookfootnote:[A _Notebook_ is the container widget which displays one of multiple
files stacked on each other, clicking on the tabs above the text display
switches the visible text files.] which contains the last active view -- the
one which had focus (input cursor ) recently. If the active view has title
_Unsaved_ and contains no text, that one is used for the new file. (Remember,
it has to be active, so you may have to click into that text area before to
indicate that you really want to fill that one.) If you try to open an
already opened file again, you will get a new view of that file using the
already existing test buffer. Generally you use a different notebook for that
so that both views are visible at the same time and you can edit the buffer
at different locations.

For vertical scrolling you can use the mouse wheel, the slider at the right
side of the text, or keyboards keys. Pressing the right mouse button opens a
context menu with _cut/copy/past_ and _undo_ support.

Most functionality is provided by _GtkSourceView_ and related widgets, that
includes text input, cursor movement, scrolling, selecting text with the mouse
and much more.

You may enter search terms into the search text entry -- occurrences are
highlighted immediately in the text area. If you enter a number prefixed with
':' view will scroll to that line. If the cursor is in the text area, you may
press `Ctrl /` to activate the search entry -- pressing `Return` key brings you
back into text area

`Ctrl+G` and `Ctrl+Shift+G` scrolls to next or previous occurrence. Or you can use
`Ctrl+F` in the text area to find the word under the cursor or the selected text.
Pressing `Ctrl+F` again turns of highlight.

=== Keyboard Shortcuts

Many useful _keyboard shortcuts_ are already defined by GTK itself. These are
listed in the table below. I tried not to modify these predefined ones,

Shortcuts are not user customizable currently -- I am not sure if there would
be a real advantage, but of course we may add that later.

The editor itself adds currently these keyboard bindings:

* kbd:[Ctrl W] : _Goto definition_ or _What is_: Place cursor over a proc name
and press kbd:[Ctrl W] -- a new tab opens and cursor jumps to that name. If an
empty view titled _Unnamed_ is available, that one is used. If you select `Reuse
Definition View` in preferences, than an existing definition view is reused,
otherwise new views are opened. If more than one notebook are open, then you
can select which of these are used for new definition views: Click into one of
the views of the desired notebook, and then use `Mark Target` from `Gears`
menu. Later we may add variants of this `Goto Definition` functionality, maybe
tooltip display of relevant block only.

* kbd:[Ctrl E] : Check source code for errors and mark these with gutter marks,
underlining and tooltip description. Error message is displayed when mouse
pointer hovers above underlined symbols. You can press `Ctrl+N` or
`Ctrl+Shift+N` to jump to next or previous error position

* kbd:[Ctrl F] : Find (highlight) word under cursor or selected text. Press
again to toggle. `Ctrl+G` or `Ctrl+Shift+G` jumps to next or previous position.

* kbd:[Ctrl Space] : If cursor is located over a period, then nimsuggest tries
to suggest _methods_. Try `1.2.` which should offer `min`, `max` and other
float related proc names. If cursor is not located on the right of a period,
then GtkSourceView calls its word provider to suggest word completions. Type
`pro` and you should get `procs`.

* kbd:[Ctrl U] : Usage of symbols. This is some form of smart search, for
example
you may use it to highlight all occurrences of a variable in a proc. Words with
the same text characters but different meaning are not highlighted. `Ctrl+N` or
`Ctrl+P` jumps to next or previous occurrence, pressing `Ctrl+U` again toggles
highlight.

* kbd:[Ctrl R] : like `Ctrl+U` but with optional replace. First press does
highlight,
next press replaces the symbols with the content of the entry in the top right.
This function offered by nimsuggest can do replace operations project wide, but
this editor restricts the operation to the current file only. Project wide
operations would be not hard to support, but may be a bit dangerous and may break
other projects.

* kbd:[Ctrl C] : Context. Type a proc name and the opening round bracket --
then this shortcut key can be used to display proc parameters in the status bar at
the bottom. If more than one proc with that name exists, then next press shows
next.

For each language symbol under the text cursor extended information is
permanently displayed in the status bar at the bottom. That statusbar may be
used for displaying other informations as well -- less important information
vanished after a few seconds.

=== Log View

You may name one of your text views `log.txt`, maybe use that name as
additional parameter when you launch the editor from command line, or create a
new empty view and use `Save As` from _gears_ menu to change its name to
`log.txt`. If that one exists, then it is used for logging. Default log level
is `warn` which means that warnings and error messages are logged. The search
entry can be used to modify log level -- type `--` followed by `error`, `warn`,
`log` or `debug`. Press `Return` to activate that level. `--log` level may give
many message, `--debug` even more.

=== What is missing

You may miss the ability to compile and execute programs from within the
editor. Personally I have no demand for that. While it would be not
difficult to add that functionality, it is not very interesting and
needs some effort, because setting of compiler options and program parameters
should be possible in the GUI. I may add that later if there really is a demand for that.

Of course more editing functions may be desired, but I do not intent to add
too many arbitrary stuff which most people will not use. This editor should
remain a simple, easy tool with a clean GUI and without too many keyboard shortcuts.
For very special, rarely used task we can always use tools like _vim_ or _sed_.

=== Final words

The tool is still in an early stage and is not much tested yet. If you should
decide to use it already for serious work, then you should always keep backups
of your source files, and you should use additional tools like `diff` to prove
source code integrity often by comparing latest edits with recent verified
backup.

While `nimsuggest` is a great tool, it has a few bugs still, which may even
crash the program. Other bugs may lead to crashes also, so save your work
often. After a crash it may be not possible to restart nimsuggest immediately,
which may gave new crashes. After about one minute it should be possible to
restart the tool. The reason for this strange behavior is inter process
socket communication -- the editor uses sockets to exchange data with nimsugest
process, and when a crash occurs, the old persisting communication ports block
new one for some time.

The `GTK` related parts seems to work well in most cases. When using split
views and hidden scroll bars I got GTK error messages sometimes -- that seems
to be a bug in GTK which is not really critical and seems to be fixed in latest
GTK 3.22 development version.

Generally it would be possible to get all the highlight information from nimsuggest. I
already have a local version of NEd which does that -- it works fine, but CPU load is really 
high because for nearly each keystroke nimsuggests has to update highlight.

As I said earlier, we may consider porting NEd to use the high level gintro bindings later. I guess that will
be some work, maybe about 100 hours, because we may have to add some missing functionallity to gintro package still.
